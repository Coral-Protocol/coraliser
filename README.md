# Coraliser

Coraliser streamlines the adoption of Coral by automating the conversion of both MCP servers and standalone agents into Coral-compatible agents. Once integrated, these agents can seamlessly receive inputs from the Coral Server and invoke their tools as needed. This makes your multi-agent system more efficient, scalable, and ready for production use without additional configuration.

## What is Coraliser?

Coraliser is a powerful tool that streamlines the integration of both MCP servers and standalone agents with the Coral Server. It automates the generation of Coral-compatible agents, eliminating the need for manual wiring or complex configurations.

Coraliser currently includes the following components:

- **mcp-coraliser**: Run coraliser.py with a c`oraliser_settings.json` file that includes connection details for multiple MCP servers. The Coraliser attempts to connect to each MCP adaptor listed and automatically generates Coral-compatible agents for the ones that are reachable. If a connection fails for any MCP adaptor, it flags the issue and proceeds to the next available MCP, ensuring uninterrupted agent generation for all valid connections.

- **agent-coraliser**: By providing an input agent in `.py` format and executing `coraliser.py`, Coraliser first validates whether the file contains a valid agent using a Language model. If it does, it generates a Coral-compatible version of that agent, ready to run within the Coral Server.

## Get Started

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
<details>

```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coraliser.git

# Navigate to the Project Directory
cd Coraliser

# Install uv
pip install uv

# Sync dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync
```
</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
<details>

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp -r .env_sample .env
```
</details> 

### 3. Setting Up and Running the MCP-Coraliser
<details>

1. **Update `coraliser_settings.json`**:  
   Provide the connection details for your MCP server(s).

2. **Run the MCP Coraliser**:

```bash
   uv run utils/langchain/mcp-coraliser/coraliser.py
```

This script validates connections and generates Coral-compatible agent scripts.

4. **Review the Generated Agents**:  
   Check files like `firecrawl_coral_agent.py`, `github_coral_agent.py` to confirm they are configured correctly.

5. **Run the Agents** (assuming your Coral Server is running):

```bash
   uv run firecrawl_coral_agent.py
```

```bash
   uv run github_coral_agent.py
```
</details> 

### 4. Setting Up and Running the Agent-Coraliser
<details>

1. **Prepare the Input Agent**:  
   Ensure you have a valid agent Python file (e.g., `agent_coraliser_sample_input.py`).

2. **Run the Agent Coraliser**:

```bash
   uv run utils/langchain/agent-coraliser/coraliser.py
```

   (Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the agent file name (including `.py` extension).)

3. **Review the Generated Agent File**:  
   Confirm the generated script matches your expectations.

4. **Run the Agent**:

```bash
uv run <generated_filename>.py
```
</details>
